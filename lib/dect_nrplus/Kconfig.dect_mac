	  Defines the number of recent Physical Common Channel (PCC) events
	  to cache. When a Physical Downlink Channel (PDC) event arrives,
	  the MAC layer searches this cache to find the corresponding PCC
	  to retrieve the full packet context. A larger cache can handle
	  more overlapping receptions but consumes more RAM.

	  The maximum time in milliseconds that a PCC event will be cached
	  while waiting for its corresponding PDC event. If the PDC does not
	  arrive within this time, the PCC entry is considered stale and will
	  be purged.

	  and verify data being sent to the MAC. This should NOT be enabled
	  for integration tests that require the real MAC send functionality.
